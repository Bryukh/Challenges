#Challenge guide

Challenges are problems that are related for a space theme.
It can be any problem as robot design and engineering or about biology problems in space,
it can be literacy problem. The main requirement -- Space.

A challenge describes a problem.
It can be a small problem or part of a more complex task.
Or it can be complex tasks for several people.

We are using internal and external challenges.
Internal - problems that we described and ask user feedback.
External - from various sites as NASA, SpaceX etc.

For each challenge, an user can publish own solution,
which include a description and additional materials (kind of them depend on the type of challenge).
Other members of the community can see, appraise and discuss solutions. For external challenges, a user can publish solution in our service for community or put the full solution in the target competition and place a link for our community with results.
